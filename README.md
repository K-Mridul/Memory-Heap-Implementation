# Memory-Heap-Implementation
Implemented the First Fit Strategy to allocate the first free memory block which can
accommodate the process and also ensured that the adjacent free block are merged
together and reused.
Extensively used the linked list data structure for heap memory
simulation. Implemented operations like insertion, deletion at the start, end and in the
middle of the doubly linked list.
